# Kaggle Cuisine Prediction in Scala

<p align="center"><img src="img.jpg" width = "700" height = "256"></p>

This is my solution of Kaggle's [What's Cooking?- Kernels Only](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking-kernels-only) competition,
where the task was to **predict a dish's cuisine (e.g. Greek, Korean, etc.), given its list of ingredients**.

It is written in Scala and Spark MLlib, in Databricks environment.

Happy Cooking!
